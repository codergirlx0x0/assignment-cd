Through this project, I learned a lot on databases. Before starting, I did not know about databases very much. I started by downloading MySQL and playing aroundon it a bit by creating new tables and deleting rows and adding rows and ordering them based on different characteristics. I then downloaded Flask and SQLAlchemy and readabout these two a bit. I was able to understand why databases were used in a large scale example. This projects also helped me sharpen my python skills. This assignment was very useful to me and I am eager to learn more about databases and tie them into my current knowledge.
Thank you!
